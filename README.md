# E-Commerce Recommendation System

Welcome to the **E-Commerce Recommendation System** repository. This project implements a hybrid recommendation system for an online retail dataset, incorporating multiple recommendation techniques like popularity-based, item-based, and user-based collaborative filtering to build a robust recommendation engine. 

This README provides:
- A complete overview of the repository.
- Instructions for setup and usage.
- A breakdown of each recommendation technique employed in this project.

## About the Project

The **E-Commerce Recommendation System** is designed to generate tailored recommendations based on transaction data from an e-commerce platform. Key features of this system include:

- **Data Analysis and Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicate entries, and inconsistencies in the retail dataset.
- **Diverse Recommendation Approaches**: Integrates various techniques to meet different recommendation needs.
- **Hybrid Recommendation**: Combines scores from all techniques for multi-faceted, reliable recommendations.

This repository contains code files in both `.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook) and `.py` (Python script) formats, covering data exploration, data cleaning, and the code for each recommendation approach.

## Recommendation Techniques

### Popularity-Based Recommendations

This approach identifies the most frequently purchased items across all customers. Key outputs include:
- **Top 10 Most Sold Products**: Based on overall purchase quantity.
- **Trending Products**: Identifies top items sold within the past year to simulate a real-time popularity trend.

### Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

This technique suggests products similar to a selected item based on purchase behavior using cosine similarity:

- **User-Item Matrix Construction**: Creates a matrix with customers as rows and items as columns, where each cell reflects the quantity purchased.
- **Similarity-Based Recommendations**: Recommends the top 10 similar items to a selected product based on cosine similarity.

### User-Based Collaborative Filtering

This approach finds users with similar purchase histories and recommends items based on similar user behaviors:

- **Item-User Matrix Construction**: Constructs a matrix with items as rows and customers as columns, representing quantity purchased.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Uses KNN to identify and recommend top items based on similar user purchase behavior.

### Hybrid Recommendation System

Combining the above approaches, the hybrid system normalizes and aggregates scores to offer comprehensive recommendations:

- **Popularity Scores**: Weighted by purchase quantity.
- **Item-Based Similarity Scores**: Weighted by similarity ranking.
- **User-Based Similarity Scores**: Weighted by similarity ranking.

This combined scoring system ensures diverse and reliable recommendations by leveraging multiple recommendation techniques.
